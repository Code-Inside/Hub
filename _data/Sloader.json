The UI (at least on the Azure DevOps Server 2020 (!)) is not really clear about how to connect those two worlds, and thats why I’m writing this short blogpost.</p>\n\n<p>First - under project settings - add a new <strong>service connection</strong>. Use the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Azure Resource Manager</code>-service. Now you should see something like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2022-10-04/azure-connection.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Azure Resource Manager\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Be aware:</strong> You will need to register app inside your Azure AD and need permissions to setup. If you are not able to follow these instructions, you might need to talk to your Azure subscription owner.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subscription id:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Copy here the id of your subscription. This can be found in the subscription details:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2022-10-04/subscription.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Azure Subscription\" /></p>\n\n<p>Keep this tab open, because we need it later!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Service prinipal id/key &amp; tenant id:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now this wording about “Service principal” is technically correct, but really confusing if your are not familar with Azure AD. A “Service prinipal” is like a “service user”/”app” that you need to register to use it.\nThe easiest route is to create an app via the <strong>Bash Azure CLI</strong>:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>az ad sp create-for-rbac --name DevOpsPipeline\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If this command succeeds you should see something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>{\n  \"appId\": \"[...GUID..]\",\n  \"displayName\": \"DevOpsPipeline\",\n  \"password\": \"[...PASSWORD...]\",\n  \"tenant\": \"[...Tenant GUID...]\"\n}\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This creates an “Serivce principal” with a random password inside your Azure AD. The next step is to give this “Service principal” a role on your subscription, because it has currently no permissions to do anything (e.g. deploy a service etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Go to the subscription details page and then to <strong>Access control (IAM)</strong>. There you can add your “DevOpsPipeline”-App as “Contributor” (Be aware that this is a “powerful role”!).</p>\n\n<p>After that use the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"appId\": \"[...GUID..]\"</code> from the command as <strong>Service Principal Id</strong>. \nUse the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"password\": \"[...PASSWORD...]\"</code> as <strong>Service principal key</strong> and the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"tenant\": \"[...Tenant GUID...]\"</code> for the <strong>tenant id</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Now you should be able to “Verify” this connection and it should work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Links:</strong>\n<a href=\"https://azuredevopslabs.com/labs/devopsserver/azureserviceprincipal/#task-2-creating-an-azure-service-principal\">This blogpost</a> helped me a lot. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal\">Here</a> you can find the official documentation.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n","Href":"https://blog.codeinside.eu/2022/10/04/azure-devops-azure-service-connection/","RawContent":null,"Thumbnail":null},{"Title":"'error MSB8011: Failed to register output.' & UTF8-BOM files","PublishedOn":"2022-08-30T23:15:00+00:00","CommentsCount":0,"FacebookCount":0,"Summary":"\n<p>Be aware: I’m not a C++ developer and this might be an “obvious” problem, but it took me a while to resolve this issue.</p>\n\n<p>In our product we have very few C++ projects.

High contrast modes are even harder.</li>\n  <li>Keyboard navigation: This one is also easy to understand, but can be really hard.

This is perfect for us since we just can use this data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-code\">The Code</h2>\n\n<p>To tackle this task I would first establish a baseline and then improve this solution step by step. Luckily they also published the scores of all submission, so we can get a sense of how well we are doing.</p>\n\n<p>For our baseline model we are going to use <a href=\"https://fasttext.cc/\">Facebooks fastText</a>. It’s simple to use, works with many languages and does not require any special hardware like a GPU. Oh, and it’s fast :)</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-load-the-data\">1. Load the data</h3>\n\n<p>After you downloaded the training data file <a href=\"https://github.com/uds-lsv/GermEval-2018-Data\">germeval2018.training.txt</a> you need to transform this data into a format that fastText can read.\nFastTexts standard format looks like this “<strong>label</strong>[your label] some text”:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>__label__offensive some insults\n__label__other have a nice day\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-train-the-model\">2.

If interested in fastText you should take a look the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606\">paper</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759\">this one</a>. For example, fastText uses character n-grams. This approach is well suited for the German language, which uses a lot of compound words.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps</h2>\n\n<p>In this very basic tutorial, we trained a model with just a few lines of Python code. There are several things you can do to improve this model. The first step would be to preprocess your data. During preprocessing you could lower case all texts, remove URLs and special characters, correct spelling, etc. After every optimization step, you can test your model and check if your scores went up.

There have been many improvements,\nhighlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annotations of the main namespace are essentially complete. Upstream\nis a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,\nbut the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible\nenhancement in this release.</li>\n<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is\na step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be\nused across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>\n<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange\nformat for array (tensor) data.</li>\n<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions. The\nnew methods provide a complete set of the methods commonly found in\nthe literature.</li>\n<li>A new configurable allocator for use by downstream projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are in addition to the ongoing work to provide SIMD support for\ncommonly used functions, improvements to F2PY, and better documentation.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.8-3.10, Python 3.7\nhas been dropped. Note that 32 bit wheels are only provided for Python\n3.8 and 3.9 on Windows, all other wheels are 64 bits on account of\nUbuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions dropping 32 bit support.\nAll 64 bit wheels are also linked with 64 bit integer OpenBLAS, which should fix\nthe occasional problems encountered by folks using truly huge arrays.</p>\n<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>\n<h3>Deprecated numeric style dtype strings have been removed</h3>\n<p>Using the strings <code>&quot;Bytes0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Datetime64&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Str0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Uint32&quot;</code>,\nand <code>&quot;Uint64&quot;</code> as a dtype will now raise a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19539\">gh-19539</a>)</p>\n<h3>Expired deprecations for <code>loads</code>, <code>ndfromtxt</code>, and <code>mafromtxt</code> in npyio</h3>\n<p><code>numpy.loads</code> was deprecated in v1.15, with the recommendation that\nusers use <code>pickle.loads</code> instead. <code>ndfromtxt</code> and <code>mafromtxt</code> were both\ndeprecated in v1.17 - users should use <code>numpy.genfromtxt</code> instead with\nthe appropriate value for the <code>usemask</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19615\">gh-19615</a>)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
