Of course Microsoft has something similar.\nIf I remember it correctly the first version was called “Live SDK” with the possibility to login with your personal Microsoft Account.</p>\n\n<p>With Office 365 and the introduction of Azure AD we were able to build an application to sign-in with a personal account via the “Live SDK” and organizational account via “Azure AD”.</p>\n\n<p>However: The developer and end user UX was far way from perfect, because the implementation for each account type was different and for the user it was not clear which one to choose.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"microsoft-graph--azure-ad-20\">Microsoft Graph &amp; Azure AD 2.0</h1>\n\n<p>Fast forward to the right way: Use the <strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-app-registration\">Azure AD 2.0 endpoint</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-1-register-your-own-application\">Step 1: Register your own application</h2>\n\n<p>You just need to register your own application in the <strong><a href=\"https://apps.dev.microsoft.com\">Application Registration Portal</a></strong>. The registration itself is a typical OAuth-application registration and you get a ClientId and Secret for your application.</p>\n\n<p>Warning: If you have “older” LiveSDK application registered under your account you need to choose <strong>Converged Applications</strong>. LiveSDK applications are more or less legacy and I wouldn’t use them anymore.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-2-choose-a-platform\">Step 2: Choose a platform</h2>\n\n<p>Now you need to choose your application platform. If you want to enable the sign-in stuff for your web application you need to choose “Web” and insert the redirect URL. After the sign-in process the token will be send to this URL.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2017-12-31/platforms.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Platforms\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-3-choose-microsoft-graph-permissions-scopes\">Step 3: Choose Microsoft Graph Permissions (Scopes)</h2>\n\n<p>In the last step you need to select what permissions your applications need. A first-time user needs to accept your permission requests. The “Microsoft Graph” is a collection of APIs that works for personal Microsoft accounts <strong>and</strong> Office 365/Azure AD account.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2017-12-31/platforms.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Platforms\" /></p>\n\n<p>The “User.Read” permission is the most basic permission that would allow to sign-in, but if you want to access other APIs as well you just need to add those permissions to your application:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2017-12-31/scopes.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Scopes\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"finish\">Finish</h2>\n\n<p>After the application registration and the selection of the needed permissions you are ready to go.

Last year we needed to buy a new certificate because the first code signing certificate was getting stale. Sadly, after the first certificate was expired we got a call from a customer who recently tried to install our software and the installer was signed with the “old” certificate. The result was the big “Warning”-screen from above.</p>\n\n<p>I checked the file and compared it to other installers (with expired certificates) and noticed that our signature didn’t had a timestamp:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2017-11-30/properties.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Properties\" /></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-solution\">The solution</h1>\n\n<p>I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2011/03/22/everything-you-need-to-know-about-authenticode-code-signing/\">this great blogpost about authenticode code signing</a> and the timestamp was indeed important:</p>\n\n<p><em>When signing your code, you have the opportunity to timestamp your code; you should definitely do this. Time-stamping adds a cryptographically-verifiable timestamp to your signature, proving when the code was signed. If you do not timestamp your code, the signature will be treated as invalid upon the expiration of your digital certificate. Since it would probably be cumbersome to re-sign every package you’ve shipped when your certificate expires, you should take advantage of time-stamping. A signed, time-stamped package remains valid indefinitely, so long as the timestamp marks the package as having been signed during the validity period of the certificate.</em></p>\n\n<p>Time-stamping itself is pretty easy and only one parameter was missing all the time… now we invoke <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/signtool-exe\">Signtool.exe</a> like this and we have a digitial signature <strong>with</strong> a timestamp:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>signtool.exe sign /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /sm /n \"Subject...\" /d \"Description...\" file.msi\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Remarks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Our code signing cert is from Digicert and they provide the timestamp URL.</li>\n  <li>SignTool.exe is part of the Windows SDK and currently is in the ClickOnce folder (e.g. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\ClickOnce\\SignTool)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\n\n","Href":"https://blog.codeinside.eu/2017/11/30/signing-with-signtool-dont-forget-the-timestamp/","RawContent":null},{"Title":"Introducing Electron.NET - building Electron Desktop Apps with ASP.NET Core","PublishedOn":"2017-10-31T00:00:00","CommentsCount":0,"FacebookCount":0,"Summary":"\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2017-10-31/electron.net-logo.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Electron.NET\" /></p>\n\n<p>The last couple of weeks I worked with my buddy <a href=\"http://www.cross-platform-blog.com/\">Gregor Biswanger</a> on a new project called <strong>“<a href=\"https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET\">Electron.NET</a>“</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As you might already guess: It is some sort of bridge between the well known <a href=\"https://electron.atom.io/\">Electron</a> and .NET.</p>\n\n<p><em>If you don’t know what Electron is: It helps to build desktop apps written in HTML/CSS/Javascript</em></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-idea\">The idea</h1>\n\n<p>Gregor asked me a while ago if it is possible to build desktop apps with ASP.NET Core (or .NET Core in general) and - indeed - there are some ideas how to make it, but unfortunatly there is no “official” UI stack available for .NET Core. \nAfter a little chat we agreed that the best bet would be to use Electron as is and somehow “embed” ASP.NET Core in it.</p>\n\n<p>I went to bed, but Gregor was keen on to build a prototyp and he did it: He was able to launch the ASP.NET Core application inside the electron app and invoke some Electron APIs from the .NET World.</p>\n\n<p>First steps done, yeah!

If you find something strange, please let me know!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The sample consists of the following projects:</p>\n\n<p><strong>IdentityTest.IdServerHost:</strong> That’s the central IdentityServer in our solution. It contains all “clients” &amp; “identityprovider” settings.\n<strong>IdentityTest.WinAuth:</strong> This is our Windows-Authentication provider. Because of the nature of WindowsAuth it needs to be an extra project. This needs to be hosted via IIS (or IIS Express) with Windows authentication enabled. The ASP.NET app acts as a bridge and will convert the Windows-Auth ticket into a SAML token, which can be integrated into the IdentityServer. It is more or less like a mini-ADFS.\n<strong>IdentityTest.WebApp:</strong> The WebApp itself can be used via browser and also hosts a WebApi. The WebApi is secured by the IdentityServer and secured pages will trigger the authentication against the IdServerHost. \n<strong>IdentityTest.WpfClient:</strong> With the WPFApp we want to get a AccessToken via a WebBrowser-Control from the IdServerHost and call the WebApi that is hosted and secured by the very same IdServerHost.</p>\n\n<p>The IdentityServer team did a great job and have a large <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3.Samples\">sample repository on GitHub</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2017-08-30/overview.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Overview\" /></p>\n\n<p>I will talk about each part in my sample. Now lets beginn with…</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-idserverhost-project\">The ‘IdServerHost’ Project</h3>\n\n<p>The IdentityServerHost is a plain ASP.NET application. To include the IdentityServer3 you need to add <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdentityServer3/\">IdentityServer3 NuGet-Package</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The code is more or less identical with the <a href=\"https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3.Samples/tree/master/source/WebHost%20(minimal)/WebHost\">Minimal-Sample from the IdentityServer3 team</a>, but I <strong>disabled the SSL</strong> requirements for my demo.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware: The IdentityServer use a certificate to sign the tokens, but this has nothing to do with the SSL certificate. This was a hard learning curve for me and IISExpress or something messed things up. In the end I disabled the SSL requirements <strong>for my development enviroment</strong> and could start to understand how each part is communicating with each other. \nThe signing certificate in the sample is the sample .pfx file from the offical samples.</p>\n\n<p>Remember: <strong>DO USE SSL IN PRODUCTION.</strong> Oh - and use the Cert-Store for the signing certificate as well!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cert-Handling in IdentityServer in a nutshell</strong>: Do use SSL in production with a valid SSL certificate and setup another certificate that the IdentityServer will use to sign the tokens.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the SSL stuff the most important stuff might be the <a href=\"https://github.com/Code-Inside/Samples/blob/master/2016/IdentityTest/IdentityTest.IdServerHost/Configuration/Clients.cs\">client-registration</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Code-Inside/Samples/blob/79fda88113a4736a465ab275fe0745dfc6aefa9a/2016/IdentityTest/IdentityTest.IdServerHost/Startup.cs#L45-L65\">identity-provider-registration</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The IdentityServer - as the auth-central - knows each ‘client’ and each ‘identity-provider’. Make sure all URLs are correct otherwise you will end up with errors. Even a slightly difference like ‘http://test.com/’ and ‘http://test.com’ (without the trailing slash at the end) will result in strange errors.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-winauth-project\">The ‘WinAuth’ Project</h3>\n\n<p>As already written this is our Windows-Authentication provider. Of course, it is only needed if you need WinAuth. If you want to use any other provider, like a Google/Microsoft/Facebook/Twitter-Login, then this is not needed.\nIt is a bridge to the enterprise world and works quite well.</p>\n\n<p>In the project I just reference the <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdentityServer.WindowsAuthentication/\">IdentityServer.WindowsAuthentication</a> NuGet-Package and I’m nearly done. \nIn the config I need to insert the URL of my IdentityServer host - those two parts needs to know each other and they will exchange public keys so they can trust each other.</p>\n\n<p>For this trust-relationship the WinAuth provider has its own certificate. Actually you can reuse the same cert from the IdentityServerHost but I’m not sure if this is super secure, but it works.</p>\n\n<p>The code and sample can also be found on the offical <a href=\"https://github.com/IdentityServer/WindowsAuthentication\">GitHub repo</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-webapp-project\">The ‘WebApp’ Project</h3>\n\n<p>This project is a regular ASP.NET MVC project with WebApi 2 included. Nothing ASP.NET Core related, but the actual doing would be pretty similar.</p>\n\n<p>On this page there are two ways to interact:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Via Browser</li>\n  <li>Via the WebApi</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Browser Auth via OpenIdConnect Auth:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The NuGet Package <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect\">Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect</a> does the heavy lifting for us. In combination with the <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies/\">Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies</a> NuGet package the authentication will kick in when someone access a [Authorize] marked Controller. The Cookie-Auth will preserve the identity information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WebApi Auth:</strong></p>\n\n<p>To use the protected WebApi with any HTTP client the request must have a JWT bearer token. The implementation is super simple with this NuGet package <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdentityServer3.AccessTokenValidation/\">IdentityServer3.AccessTokenValidation</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Setup of both auth options:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The setup is quite easy with the NuGet packages:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>public class Startup\n{\n    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)\n    {\n        app.UseIdentityServerBearerTokenAuthentication(new IdentityServerBearerTokenAuthenticationOptions\n        {\n            Authority = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"Security.Authority\"],\n            RequiredScopes = new[] { \"openid\" }\n        });\n\n        app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions()\n        {\n            AuthenticationType = \"cookies\",\n        });\n\n        app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions()\n        {\n            AuthenticationType = \"oidc\",\n            SignInAsAuthenticationType = \"cookies\",\n            Authority = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"Security.Authority\"],\n            ClientId = \"webapp\",\n            RedirectUri = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"Security.RedirectUri\"],\n            ResponseType = \"id_token\",\n            Scope = \"openid all_claims\"\n        });\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>It is important to use the correct “clientIds” and URLs as configured in the IdentityServer, otherwise you will receive errors from the IdentityServer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-wpfclient-project\">The ‘WpfClient’ Project</h3>\n\n<p>This project is a small version of the original <a href=\"https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3.Samples/tree/master/source/Clients/WpfOidcClientPop\">WpfOidcClientPop</a> sample. The idea behind this sample is that a user can sign in with his regular account.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Auth via browser:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Instead of a Loginname/Password form rendered from the WPF app itself the authentication is delegated to a embedded browser control. Another option is to delegate it to the “real” installed browser, but this is another topic. \nThe Microsoft Account login in Visual Studio is made that way or think of any popular “Facebook-Login” mobile app on your phone: The auth-process is basically a typical Web signin.</p>\n\n<p>This scenario is also convered as a offical <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/wg/oauth/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps/\">OpenID Connect specification</a>. In WPF your best and easiest choice would be the <a href=\"https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.OidcClient2\">IdentityModel.OidcClient2</a> package.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Auth “Steps”</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first step in the sample project is to aquire a access token from the IdentityServer. The actual implementation is thanks to the OidcClient quite simple as you can see <a href=\"https://github.com/Code-Inside/Samples/blob/c5d42f9b3ca61a6171eed684c57d94cac2297bf2/2016/IdentityTest/IdentityTest.WpfClient/MainWindow.xaml.cs#L44-L49\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The OidcClient will try to get the needed accesstoken in the silent mode first (this can be configured) and if this fails a embedded browser will be rendered and the user needs to sign in there. After a successful signin you will get a <strong>accesstoken and refreshtoken</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sample note:</strong> If you try this on your local machine the auth-window should not appear, because it will just do a “silent” windows auth login.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multiple IdentityProvider:</strong> If you configure multiple identity provider, a simple designed identity selection will appear in the embedded browser window.</p>\n\n<p>After the intial sign in you can regenerate new accesstokens via the refreshtoken.</p>\n\n<p>With the accesstoken <a href=\"https://github.com/Code-Inside/Samples/blob/c5d42f9b3ca61a6171eed684c57d94cac2297bf2/2016/IdentityTest/IdentityTest.WpfClient/MainWindow.xaml.cs#L95-L99\">we craft a HTTP request</a> to our beloved WebApi and write use the token in the authorization header and finally we are done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Things to consider:</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is important <a href=\"https://github.com/Code-Inside/Samples/blob/c5d42f9b3ca61a6171eed684c57d94cac2297bf2/2016/IdentityTest/IdentityTest.WpfClient/MainWindow.xaml.cs#L77-L83\">to setup the OIDCClient</a> the correct way with the values that you specified in your IdentityServer configuration. Also you should read about OpenID scopes because they are linked to the actual result. Without the correct scope you might not get a accesstoken or refreshtoken.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2017-08-30/wpf.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"wpf\" /></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"summary\">Summary</h1>\n\n<p>With these 4 projects we have a quite mighty solution created.

I’m not 100% sure if this step is really needed, but I needed to do it, otherwise I couldn’t install the app:</p>\n\n<p>Now click on the pfx and enter the password “apptest” and import it in the “Trusted Root CAs”:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2016-09-30/trust.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Importing the pfx\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sign-appappx\">Sign App.appx</h2>\n\n<p>Now we need to sign the package and we are done:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\x64\\signtool.exe\" sign /f \"App.pfx\" -fd SHA256 /p apptest \"App.appx\"\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"install-the-app\">Install the App!</h2>\n\n<p>Now you can double click on the appx package and the installer will show up:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2016-09-30/install.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"install the app\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"running-the-app\">Running the App</h2>\n\n<p>And there is our beauty:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2016-09-30/app.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"running the app\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"exploring-the-sandbox\">Exploring the sandbox:</h2>\n\n<p>Remember our 3 methods? The results of those three calls are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Write to the Registry: Seems to work for the app, but (as expected) the registry value will not leak out of the “sandbox”</li>\n  <li>Write to %appdata%: Seems to work for the app, but the data value will not leak out of the “sandbox”</li>\n  <li>Open a browser: The default browser will be invoked for a HTTP url.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It was my first try to convert a (simple) WPF app to UWP and the result is interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Hope my first steps in this world might help you!</p>\n\n<p>The code and a handy readme.txt is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/Code-Inside/Samples/tree/master/2016/WpfToUwpTestApp\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"from-the-comments-fun-with-registydat-files\">From the comments: Fun with registy.dat files:</h2>\n\n<p>James Hancock/John Galt discovered a nice registy trick. His goal was to “fake” a given registry key, so that the converted UWP app can see a “virtual” registry key. This can be done with a file named “registry.dat”.</p>\n\n<p>The registry.dat seems to be the source and target of all write actions inside the app:</p>\n\n<p>“The virtual registery is always the registry.dat. if you don’t provide a default version then one is created on first use for you.</p>\n\n<p>But if you do, then yes you can deploy whatever entries you want as a starting point for your app otherwise the starting point is whatever that computer currently has in the real registry.”</p>\n\n<p>You can create such registry.dat files via RegEdit &amp; export it as registry hive. Be aware, that my test run wasn’t successful, but I hope to get working sample. Until that I hope James comments will be helpful.</p>\n","Href":"https://blog.codeinside.eu/2016/09/30/lets-convert-a-wpf-app-to-uwp-via-the-uwp-bridge/","RawContent":null},{"Title":"TFS 2015: Adding a new Windows Build Agent","PublishedOn":"2016-08-10T00:00:00","CommentsCount":0,"FacebookCount":0,"Summary":"\n<h2 id=\"the-tfs-2015-build-system\">The TFS 2015 Build System</h2>\n\n<p>The build system before TFS 2015 was based on a pretty arcane XAML workflow engine which was manageable, but not fun to use.

It comes with some nice features, like code folding support, text highlighting and infrastructure for advanced features like autocompletion.</p>\n\n<p>Read more about AvalonEdit on the <a href=\"http://avalonedit.net/\">offical site</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To install AvalonEdit, just create a WPF project and install the <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/AvalonEdit/\">AvalonEdit NuGet package</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"our-scenario\">Our Scenario</h2>\n\n<p>We use AvalonEdit to edit XML configurations, but it can be used with any language. This blogpost will only take a look at our XML-scenario.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"xml-autocomplete-or-intellisense\">XML Autocomplete or “IntelliSense”</h2>\n\n<p>AvalonEdit only ships with Syntax-Highlighting for XML - but nothing more. To get something like Tag-Autocompletion or even something like “IntelliSense” I had to combine different code pieces and write something new. So… the daily business of any programmer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"xml-tag-completion---with-code-from-sharpdevelop-and-xsemmel\">XML Tag-Completion - with Code from SharpDevelop and Xsemmel</h3>\n\n<p>Modern text editors will autocomplete given XML tags, e.g. if I type the closing element for “&lt;foo” it will create something like “<foo></foo>” and set the cursor inside the element.\nTo get to this feature we need to know which XML tag we are currently try to write - this issue can be solved with some magic RegEx0.</p>\n\n<p>The good part: This is already a solved problem. I discovered a very clever XmlParser on the <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop/tree/master/src/AddIns/DisplayBindings/XmlEditor\">SharpDevelop GitHub Repo</a></strong> and another one from the <strong><a href=\"https://xsemmel.codeplex.com/\">Xsemmel Project</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I use code from both projects and integrated it in my sample project. And I hope I didn’t break the license by doing it - if yes I did it unintentional. Each code part is marked with the source and the copyright notes are included as well.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway: <strong>Huge credits are going to both projects.</strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-i-get-from-those-libraries\">What I get from those libraries?</h3>\n\n<p>Both libraries are clever enough to parse XML - or even “invalid” XML, and return the current position inside the XML tree. The code from Xsemmel also helped me with the “pure” tag completion.</p>\n\n<p>My merged XmlParser will return me the needed information for autocompletion or even “IntelliSense”-like features.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"xml-intellisense---whats-the-source-of-the-intellisense\">XML “IntelliSense” - What’s the source of the “IntelliSense”?</h3>\n\n<p>To present some clever autocomplete actions, we need a source for this information. The good thing about XML is, that there is a huge range of related standards around it. The idea is simple:</p>\n\n<p>Using an <strong>existing XML Schema</strong> should do the trick. I already blogged about it <strong><a href=\"http://blog.codeinside.eu/2016/03/06/parsing-xml-schemas-in-dotnet/\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"putting-those-pieces-together\">Putting those pieces together:</h3>\n\n<p>I created a WPF project, included the AvalonEdit NuGet package and the code portions I already mentioned. The performance in the animation is a bit slow, because I wanted to show you what the XmlParser is doing in the background - this can be seen at the bottom of the application.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2016-03-13/xmleditor.gif\" alt=\"x\" title=\"AvalonEdit with XML Autocompletion\" />.</p>\n\n<p>You don’t need to “query” the document everytime you change the cursor - so in real life the performance hit is not very noticeable.</p>\n\n<p>As I already mentioned in the XSD-blogpost: XML Namespaces will not work with this implementation. As far as I know the SharpDevelop code should understand namespaces, but at least my XSD parser is not smart enough.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-logic\">The logic</h3>\n\n<p>The most interesting logic happens in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Code-Inside/Samples/blob/master/2016/XmlIntelliSense/XmlIntelliSense.App/MainWindow.xaml.cs#L40\">TextEntered-EventHandler</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The “&gt;” and “/” key is interesting for the simple tag autocompletion. The “XsdParser”-Result is used when you hit the “&lt;” key or “ “ as long as you are inside a tag for attribute autocompletion.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"good-enough\">“Good enough”</h3>\n\n<p>My implementation is far away from perfection, but should be good enough for most simple cases. As I already mentioned, the heavy lifting is done by code from SharpDevelop or Xsemmel. My sample is self-contained and only relies on the AvalonEdit NuGet package and the standard WPF.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Code-Inside/Samples/tree/master/2016/XmlIntelliSense\">Full Sample Code on GitHub</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n","Href":"https://blog.codeinside.eu/2016/03/13/xml-autocompletion-with-avalonedit/","RawContent":null},{"Title":"Parsing XML Schemas in .NET","PublishedOn":"2016-03-06T00:00:00","CommentsCount":0,"FacebookCount":0,"Summary":"\n<h2 id=\"xml-schemas\">XML Schemas</h2>\n\n<p>XML can be very verbose and seems to be old-fashioned, but the good part around XML is, that there is a hugh pile of standardized mechanics around it. \nTo query XML documents you can use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath\">XPath</a>, for transforming <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT\">XSLT</a> and for validation <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)\">XML Schemas</a></strong> or in short a “XSD” (XML Schema Definition).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"parsing-the-xsd-tree\">Parsing the XSD Tree</h2>\n\n<p>A XSD is just a XML document itself that describes the your valid XML document tree.

Jekyll is a static website generator, which means that this page is “build” and has no server-side rendering logic when you hit the page - it’s pure static HTML, CSS and JS.</p>\n\n<p>You could run Jekyll on your local box and publish the sites to GitHub Pages - I prefer a pure “GitHub Page”-based model. Actually I don’t even have Jekyll installed on my PC. <a href=\"http://blog.codeinside.eu/2014/09/13/How-We-Moved-From-Wordpress-To-Jekyll-On-Windows/\">I wrote a small blogpost about running Jekyll on Windows if you are interested</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travis-ci\"><strong><a href=\"http://travis-ci.org\">Travis CI</a></strong></h2>\n\n<p>As you might imaging - during the build stuff can break. In this case GitHub will send you a very short “error” email via mail. To get a more detailed report, <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-jekyll-build-error-messages/\">GitHub suggests to use Travis CI</a>, which is the main topic of this blogpost.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travis-ci-setup\">Travis CI Setup</h2>\n\n<p>The basic setup is pretty simple, but I had some issues - the last step is not very good documented - and that’s why I decided to blog about it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-login-to-travis-ci-and-sync-your-account\">1. Login to Travis CI and “sync” your account</h3>\n\n<p>You will need to login to Travis CI with your GitHub account. This will kick in a “sync”. After a short period you should see all your repositories on your profile page:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2016-03-03/travisci-1.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Travis CI Profile Page\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-enable-the-desired-project-on-travis-ci\">2. Enable the desired project on Travis CI</h3>\n\n<p>Just flip on the switch on your profil page for the desired project and Travis will watch the repository for any changes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-adding-a-gemfile-and-a-travisyml-file-to-your-project\">3. Adding a Gemfile and a .travis.yml file to your project</h3>\n\n<p>To build GitHub Page stuff via Travis you will need a <a href=\"https://github.com/Code-Inside/Blog/blob/gh-pages/Gemfile\">Gemfile</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/Code-Inside/Blog/blob/gh-pages/.travis.yml\">.tarvis.yml</a>.\nMy current files are pretty basic and a copy from the GitHub Pages Help site, with <strong>one important exception</strong>…</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-targeting-the-correct-branch\">4. Targeting the correct branch</h3>\n\n<p>The last step is to ensure that Travis CI will search for the correct branch. In my case, I only have the “gh-pages” branch, but Travis CI will look for a “master” branch.</p>\n\n<p>To configure Travis CI to use the correct “gh-pages” branch you will need this config section inside the .yml:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>branches:\n only:\n - gh-pages  \n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>After this setup you should already see the finished Travis CI build:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.codeinside.eu/assets/md-images/2016-03-03/travisci-2.png\" alt=\"x\" title=\"Travis CI Build Page\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> The output of the build will not be copied over to GitHub - at this stage it is just a “safety net”. If you want to publish from Travis CI, there are many blogposts out there that describe this topic.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n","Href":"https://blog.codeinside.eu/2016/03/03/using-travis-ci-for-github-page-builds/","RawContent":null},{"Title":"Pretty Print XML in .NET","PublishedOn":"2016-02-28T00:00:00","CommentsCount":0,"FacebookCount":0,"Summary":"\n<h2 id=\"pretty-print\">Pretty Print</h2>\n\n<p>The term “pretty print” describes that a document is more or less human readable formatted.

Definitely a recipe for burning a ton of extra time debugging the wrong exe, and trying to remember to either manually clean bin and obj before each build or manually doing an explicit build step (which spews less into the terminal window) before running start.
